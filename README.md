# raytracer-challenge-rs

This is an implementation of the raytracer from the book The Ray Tracer 
Challenge by Jamis Buck using the Rust programming language

# Issues/TODOs
Problems with adding vectors and points, should a point + vector be a point or a vector.

Should we add the w component in Add/Sub for vectors? This may be good to do since that would mean
a vector plus point would equal to point, a vector + vector would equal vector, and a point + point would give
a result of a w = 2.0. Which we could then detect as an error?

So far it looks like adding w component is the right call. 


## Groups stores copies of it's child objects. Also same issue with Intersections list, its storing a copy of the objects. 
This causes big memory issues. Rendering groups took 5 minutes and 30GB of memory used.

## Glitches with rendering cone.
There is some kind of ray intersection floating point rounding errors occuring causing graphical glitches.
These show up as dark pixels in a arc across the image. It seems to be related to the refracted and reflected
colors. It disppaears if we set the REFLECT_RAYS to 1, and shows if we set it greater than one

When we disabled shadows, the glitch also went away. This means that somehow the reflection ray is probably striking
the cone where the color is pure black.  When this glitch occured we also had the Light source at -20, 10, -5 and the
cone was :

                          .then(Matrix4x4::scaling(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))
```

The shadow glitch is narrowed down to Cone::intersect, had to increase test of f64_eq(a, 0) to a.abs() < 0.000000001
The f64_eq(a, 0.0) with epsilon of 0.00001 was too high. This fixes the issue, but not sure if its resolved.
# FAQ

Q: How do I actually render an image?


A: There is currenly no code in src/main.rs. If you want to see an image, look
   in the tests directory for tests that are marked as disabled (#[ignore="render"]).
   Re-enable the tests and run 
   
```
cargo test --release
```

The rendering will output a .ppm file which you can view in Preview.app
